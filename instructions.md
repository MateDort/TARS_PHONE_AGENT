OKay granny AI is a system I built for the elderly people, but i woild like to turn it into my own assistant TARS I cloned the repo into hear fro reference. Create the exact same system as GrannyAI but leave out the Hungarian speaking part I only need english and make the TARS's prompt load with the config so it doesnt check the prompt every time before answering but knows who it is. I made a TARS.md that contains it's personality and a Máté.md that contains my information, we can reference that in the prompt for it to read it when setting up the system. Also make parts of the config file be editable like setting humor percentage and honesty percantage so i can say set humor to 65% or ask what percantage it is on now. it can edit the config and reload it and carries on without me having stop the system. 


update we need to make sure that if another phone number calls TARS then mine it asks user if they want to talk to me and notify me about the conversation and its transcription summery but does not do anything I can ask for him to do
